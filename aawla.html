            <div><p><h3>Indian gooseberry is known by two scientific names — Phyllanthus emblica and Emblica officinalis. It’s also commonly called amla.

                This small tree has yellow-green flowers that blossom into round, edible fruits of the same color.
                
                The fruits are about the size of a golf ball with a pit and thin peel. Their taste has been described as sour, bitter, and astringent.
                
                The fruit is used in cooking in India, and most supplements on the market today are made only from the powdered, dried fruit or fruit extracts.
                
                However, the whole plant — including the fruit, leaves, and seeds — is utilized in traditional Indian medicine</h3></p></div>
