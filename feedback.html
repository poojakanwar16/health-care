            08. I don’t know why I waited so long to try yoga. I’ve had hip pain for nearly a year. My orthopedic doctor sent me to physical therapy and it seemed that my pain increased. After two yoga sessions with (YN) I no longer have hip pain.         --------  -kirshna

                  <p class="card-text">“True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life. Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. Yoga doesn’t care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming. Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, its essence must be embodied.” —Aadil Palkhivala</p>
