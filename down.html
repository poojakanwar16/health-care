                <h2>What Is Downward Dog?</h2>
                <p>When you think of yoga, you probably have the image of a downward-facing dog. Adho Mukha Svanasana is one of the most popular yoga poses, perhaps even the most famous
                    <br>.The dog looking down reflects the entirety of yoga practice in a single pose: it requires strength and flexibility, teaches to appreciate precise alignment, and gives qualities such as stability, presence, and spaciousness that can be cultivated outside of yoga class.<br>

                    Although it is a popular posture, it is not simple and involves many details to pay attention to. It can be both a strengthening pose and a resting pose. In addition, it often serves as a transitional pose in a yoga flow and is also incorporated into sun salutations.</p>
                    <h2>Is the Downward Dog Suitable for Beginners?</h2>
                    <p>The posture is suitable for beginners but can be challenging.<br>

                        It requires precise alignment and strength in the wrists, shoulders, and core. However, whether you are doing yoga for the first time or have previous experience, the benefits of the downward dog are genuinely limitless.</p>
