                <p>
                    Hamsasana or Swan pose is an intermediate-level yoga pose, that balances the entire body on toes and hands, which needs a great level of arm and shoulder strength. This pose is a preparatory pose for the Mayurasana (peacock pose), which is an advanced level and a variation of the plank pose.
