                        loe vera has been widely grown as an ornamental plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a topical medicinal plant[39] and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens.[26] The species is hardy in zones 8â€“11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow.[29][40] The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health.[41][42] This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[43]
